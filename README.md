# Zim Attachment Browser Plugin

This plugin shows the attachments folder of the current page as an
icon view at bottom pane.

In addition to the already existing "Attachment Browser" by Thorsten Hackbarth and Jaap Karssenberg 
this plugin adds a context menu entry for renaming and deleting files.

# Setup

1. Put the `attachment-browser` folder into the plugins folder `~/.local/share/zim/plugins/` in Linux.
2. Enable the plugin in Zim via `Edit > Preferences > Plugins` and check mark the `Attachment-Browser` plugin.
